The tool is made for medical image analysis (glaucoma images) but you can use it to manipulate other images also interactively. Please refer to 'Docs' folder for the research paper on which this toolkit is based on.

Buttons which are functional and tested:
1> Browse Image
2> Crop Image
3> Panel (please use either rotation or translation for one GMP i.e. set rotation and translation parameters separately).
	Interactive Rotation
	Interactive Translation
4> Coalesce
5> Add New GMP
6> Close GUI

Functionalities:

1.) Browse the Image say I.
2.) If you wish to crop the image the click on 'Crop Image'.
    Select the rectangular ROI and then double click on it.
3.) Choose either rotation or translation from the panel.
    
3.1.) Rotation: Click on 'Select Center' to select the desired       point around which the image is to be rotated.

      Step Size: 4(default) means 360/4 degrees.i.e. rotate the image by 90deg, 180d, 270d and 360degrees respectively.
	
      No. of Rounds(n): means 360*n. So for a StepSize of 4, eight rotated images will be formed.

      Rotate: This will actually rotate the image taking all the parameters into consideration.

3.2) Translation: 
	Select Origin: Click on it and select the desired point on the image as first(tail) point of the vector.
	Select Destination: Click on it and select the desired point on the image as the last(head) point of the vector.
	
	Step Size: indicates that the length of the selected vector will be divided into these many steps. Ex. Step = 10 and Length of the vector along x and y axis is (x,y)=(200,350), then each image will be generated by shifting the last image by (20,35)units. (Length is calculated as pixel difference along x and y axis respectively).

	Translate: Generates translated images according to the parameters.

4.) Add New GMP: This is a key functionality of this Toolkit. On clicking this button, a new GUI will be opened, with the same image (or a different image can also be browsed and clipped). Now you again have the option to choose either Rotation or Translation. After selecting the desired transformation, set the parameters - Select point(s), Step Size etc. and click on Translate OR Rotate. As soon as you click on this button, the generated images will be saved and now clicking on Coalesce will show the result by coalescing images generated from both the transformation. 
There is no limit to adding new GMPs. 

[
Internally, the variable GMPCount is incremented as 'Add New GMP' button is clicked. The new images generated are stored in a cell array referenced like this:

FinalImages{GMPCount} = translatedImages OR rotatedImages

size(translatedImages) => m x n x StepSize
size(rotatedImages)    => m x n x StepSize*Rounds

]

5.) Coalesce: It takes all the images from all the GMPs. and then coalesce the images according to the specified function. 
It also Resizes the images such that all images have dimensions equal to max_row_size and max_col_size calculated from all the images so that the dimensions are consistent.

New functions can be added easily by checking the callback routine of the Coalesce button.




Using Toolkit.. Example:

1.) Run Toolkit_MPA-> Browse Image.	          [GMP1]
2.) Crop Image(definitely crop if dimensions exceed 1000pix.otherwise time consuming in transformation)
   Crop Image -> Select ROI-> Double Click in ROI.[GMP1]
3.) Translation_1: Select parameters-> Translate. [GMP1]
4.) Add New GMP. 				  [GMP1]
5.) Translation_2: Select parameters-> Translate. [GMP2]
6.) Add New GMP. 				  [GMP2]
7.) Rotation_1:    Select parameters-> Rotate.	  [GMP3]
8.) Coalesce ->    Select Function  -> OUTPUT(GMP 1,2 & 3 combined)  [GMP3]
9.) Close GUI.->   Close all windows.


BUGS and ISSUES: 

The following bugs are known and will be resolved in the next version.

1.) Coalesce result is shown in a separate GUI window with parameters. The parameters are incorrect, please ignore them.

2.) Image Config features like Resize, Save Results and parameter config features like Reset parameters options in the last panel(bottom right) are not tested yet. 

3.) To reset everything and start from scratch, click on 'Close GUI' button in the bottom right panel and then close all the windows manually. This will reset the internal environment and all variables to default. This is cumbersome and will be resolved.

4.) In Translation, the origin and destination coordinates must not have same x or same y values. otherwise it will result in divide by zero error.
